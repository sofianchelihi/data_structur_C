# 📚 Data Structures in C


## Project Overview

The **data_structur_C** repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures in the **C programming language**. This project serves as a learning resource for understanding and applying various data structures, including their algorithms and use cases in real-world programming.

## Included Data Structures

- 📂 **Linked Lists** (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- 🏷️ **Stacks** and **Queues**
- 🌳 **Trees** (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree)
- 🎲 **Graphs** (with BFS and DFS traversal)
- 🗂️ **Hash Tables**
- 📊 **Sorting Algorithms** (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** C
- **Development Tools:** GCC (or any C compiler)
- **Concepts Covered:** Pointers, Dynamic Memory Allocation, Recursion

## Installation

To compile and run the code locally:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sofianchelihi/data_structur_C.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd data_structur_C
    ```

3. Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):

    ```bash
    gcc -o program_name source_file.c
    ```

4. Run the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./program_name
    ```

## Usage

- Each folder corresponds to a specific data structure or algorithm. Navigate to the relevant directory to explore its implementation.
- Modify or extend the programs for practice and deeper understanding.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions or improvements, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
